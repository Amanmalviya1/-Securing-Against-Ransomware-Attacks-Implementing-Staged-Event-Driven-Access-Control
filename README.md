# Securing Against Ransomware Attacks: Implementing Staged Event-Driven Access Control

This repository contains code and resources related to implementing a Staged Event-Driven Access Control (SEAC) system to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks.

## Project Overview

Ransomware attacks pose a significant threat to data security. This project explores the use of SEDAC as a defense mechanism. SEAC allows for controlled access to files and resources based on a series of staged events, limiting the potential damage from unauthorized access.

## Key Features

* Staged Access Control: Implements a multi-stage access control mechanism.
* Event-Driven Architecture: Uses an event-driven model to trigger access control changes.
* Ransomware Mitigation:Designed to limit the impact of ransomware encryption.


## Implementation Details

* Programming Language: Python, Java, etc.
* Libraries/Frameworks:Flask, Django, Yara etc.


## Getting Started
